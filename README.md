## The Age of Enlightenment
During the age of Enlightenment, most of the basic ideas that inspired future revolutions were introduced, debated, and discussed.  The Age of Enlightenment is also called the Age of Reason.  Many of the philosophers you will investigate during this activity will be used as inspiration for the American, French, and Latin American Revolutions.  

## Directions
Your group will create a collector’s set of trading cards based on the Enlightenment thinkers listed later in this document.  Working with a group, you will research the thinkers and create a collaborative collection (one where you share your work with your group) of your uniquely created deck.
1. Divide the thinkers equally among your group
2. Each person is responsible for researching the thinkers assigned to them
3. Create a common theme or template.
4. Within the groups, the only topic of conversation should be about the thinkers and the assignment
5. Each group will receive a group grade that will indicate not only completion of the task, but it will also contain an element dedicated to how well you were on task and worked together as a group.

### FRONT:

- What were the thinkers’ main ideas or philosophies? Must list at least two.
